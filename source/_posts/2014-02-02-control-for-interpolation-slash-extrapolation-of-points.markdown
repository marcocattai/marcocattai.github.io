This DLL allow you to draw points on a Cartesian plane. Points will be interpolated using linear interpolation or spline cubic interpolation (i will give you this interpolation only if you ask me, this version of software doesn't have it). You can also change the value of a single point changing directly its value. You can enable or disable floating points or dicrete points visualization only selecting the option button. You can cancel points and you can ask for the extrapolation's value of any point you need for any specific X value that you want.
