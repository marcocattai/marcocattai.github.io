This Software allow, using a DLL that I realized in C#/Direct3D, to visualize a 3D Map. You can modify the graph using direct manipulation of the intersection points or using 2D section's views. Below you can see images, video and a downlodable example that show how it works.

I developed this for my dissertation at university and it is used in more complex software I did in 2008. The component is not the original one I did for Aprilia, the interface is different and a lot of functionalities are missing here. The original software allow the correction of injection maps of a four stroke engine. It is used for the correction of injection maps of Aprilia RSV4 (Superbike team). This component was also a simple way to see the injection maps using a 3D View.
