I never share nothing using github, but maybe I will start in the next months coz I have a lot of projects or components on my side:). My last work is this custom UICollectionViewLayout that is similar to the iOS 7 application's menu. I enjoyed a lot doing this interface. It is fully customizable, starting from little particoulars as the animation of the spacing between the bundle's items while they are zoomed. All the animations are easly customizable and it allow subfolding at multiple levels also if I don't find them really useful. 

<h3>
Next step: I will insert the drag and drop feature and maybe when I will have time I want to write an article about it sharing the relative code on gitHub.
